Interface in Java

we have 3 valid structures in Java
1) Concreate class -> fully implemented
2) abstract class -> partial implemented
3) interface -> fully unimplemented

interface can contains only abstract method and constant variables
(public static final).

from java 8interface can contain some special methods which have body.
